\begin{project}{Design I2C controller core}
    \subsection*{1. Description}
    I2C protocol was invented by Philips semiconductors in the 1980s, to provide easy onboard communications between a CPU and various peripheral chips.
    I2C stands for Inter-Integrated Circuit.
    It is used for attaching lower-speed peripheral ICs to microcontrollers in short-distance communication.
    Low-speed peripherals include external EEPROMs, digital sensors, I2C LCD, and temperature sensors.

    Design I2C Master Core: provides an interface between a Wishbone Master and an I2C bus, compatible with Philips I2C bus standard and Wishbone bus.

\begin{project}{Design a RISC Stored-Program Machine}
    \subsection*{1. Description}
    Reduced instruction-set computers (RISC) are designed to have a small set of instructions that execute in short clock cycles, with a small number of cycles per instruction.
    RISC machines are optimized to achieve efficient pipelining of their instruction streams.
    The machine also serves as a starting point for developing architectural variants and a more robust instruction set.
    Designers make high-level tradeoffs in selecting an architecture that serves an application.
    Once an architecture has been selected, a circuit that has sufficient performance (speed) must be synthesized.
    Hardware description languages (HDLs) play a key role in this process by modeling the system and serving as a descriptive medium that can be used by a synthesis tool.
