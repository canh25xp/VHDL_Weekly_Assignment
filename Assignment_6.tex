\begin{problem}{4-to-1 Multiplexer using Data Flow}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Design a 4-to-1 Multiplexer using dataflow statements.
        \item Write testbench and simulate your design.
    \end{itemize}
    \note{You can re-use the testbench module that you created earlier for the Structural 4-to-1 Multiplexer in Assignment 3.
    The simulation result should be the same.}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{4-bit Carry Lookahead Adder using Data Flow}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Design a 4-bit Carry LookAhead Adder using dataflow statements.
        \item Write testbench and simulate your design.
        \item Compare it with the 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder that you created in Assignment 3 (Structure, delay, speed)
    \end{itemize}
